This program used to be a Folder locker with AES-256 Encryption(fake,just gimmick)

It looks cool ,so your friend will  ask ,how 


How to use:
-Edit the batch file (password and folder name)
Open Bat to Exe converter
select the files,And then tick the Password box to add more password
Click Convert And your Folder Locker Created

Note:
I use bat to exe for other people cant change or see my password

Default password for file you download is 
 1ST pass :ekeng990
 2ND Pass: michael990
